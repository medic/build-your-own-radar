Klipfolio,Adopt,Data Use,FALSE,"<p>Klipfolio is a paid third-party SAAS option for building dashboards.

From Wikipedia article:
Klipfolio offers an online dashboard platform for building real-time business dashboards. It allows business users to connect to many data services, automate data retrieval, and then manipulate, and visualize the data. Klipfolio uses a schema-less architecture that allows non-technical end users to more easily connect to data sources, and separates data from presentation to more efficiently use and reuse data sources throughout the platform.

Klipfolio has built-in formula editing, allowing end-users to transform, combine, slice, and filter any data before visualizing it. Users are able to access the dashboard from their desktop, tablet, TV, and mobile phone, and share it with colleagues by granting access to the dashboard, or by scheduling email reports.</p>",Techniques

OpenHIE,Trial,Data Use,FALSE,"<p>OpenHIE is a community of practice that also provides an architecture and specification for interoperability for the digital health ecosystem. Medic is an active partner in the OpenHIE community, and strives to use OpenHIE standards in designing and building integrations.

From OpenHIE:
A Health Information Exchange (HIE) makes sharing health data across information systems possible. It enables data to be shared between databases, facilities, and across regions or countries.

OpenHIE’s Architecture is made up of patterns that ensure that health information from various external systems is gathered into a single, uniﬁed HIE. To accomplish this, the exchange normalizes the context in which health information is used by focusing on the “for whom”, ”by whom”, “where”, and “what” of a patient’s health visit, bringing relevant information through a layer of interoperability and directly to the point of service. Additionally, OpenHIE also integrates medical supply data. This supports enhanced decision-making, improves the quality, safety, and continuity of care, and facilitates the appropriate use of information to improve health in a population.</p>",Techniques
XLSForm,Adopt,App Building,FALSE,<p>XLSForm is a form standard created to help simplify the authoring of forms in Excel. Authoring is done in a human readable format using a familiar tool that almost everyone knows - Excel. XLSForms provide a practical standard for sharing and collaborating on authoring forms.

Purging,Adopt,Data Use,FALSE,<p>Purging is a tool that allows you to increase performance and available disk space for offline users (eg CHWs) by removing unneeded documents from their device. As users continually generate new reports their performance may naturally degrade as a result. You can use purging to remove older documents that are no longer relevant from their devices. Purging only removes documents from user’s devices: these reports are still available for online analytics and impact metrics.</p>,Techniques

Training Cards,Adopt,CHT App Features,FALSE,"<p>Training Cards enable remote training from within the CHT by showing a sequence of “cards” containing content provided by App Developers. The content might include information about a newly deployed feature, changes to a care guide, or simply a reminder about an underused feature or workflow. Enketo forms are used to display the content, and App Developers can specify a start date, duration, and to which user roles the cards should be shown. Like app forms, forms used by training cards will automatically be downloaded to the user’s devices.</p>",Tools
Targets,Adopt,CHT App Features,FALSE,"<p>Dashboards to track metrics for an individual CHW or for an entire health facility. Targets is the user dashboard or analytics tab.

Configurable Hierarchies,Adopt,CHT App Features,FALSE,"<p>Organizing people and places, and their relationship to one-another. The Core Framework requires a hierarchy to organize the information in the app. It is often based on the hierarchy of a health system within a particular geographic region. Large deployment sites often need three or more levels of place hierarchy, while some small sites need fewer than three levels. For this reason, the Core Framework’s information hierarchies are configurable to meet a users needs.</p>",Tools
